### Yo ðŸ‘‹
I started my development journey from 2017, after two years at Webstart school, I left it before the end of my license to get started.

I love the JavaScript environment, it's the language I use most of the time when I code, but my main goal is to be useful, if I need to learn a new language, I learn. It is the essence of our profession.

When I'm not coding I'm a professional volleyball player.

Most of the time I'm busy working at Smartness on a project called Ko, hopefully we can release it soon.

We can connect on LinkedIn or you can email me at arthur.delbeke.pro [at] gmail.com
